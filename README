appointment-managing-bot-for-self-employed
==========================================

This bot is made for self employed people who provide
their service in person. It uses simple
contractor-client role model. At first, a contractor
creates a list of appointments (date and time records)
that are suitable for him/her (fit in his/her schedule).
Then, a client can make an appointment with the contractor
choosing the date-time record out of a list made by the
contractor. The only thing here that needed to be made
by contractor is to create these records.

For example, the contractor can be a manicurist (as a
person I have made this bot to), beauty master, tutor
or any other person who provides their service in
person and needs automatic appointment management.

Terms of use:
You can basically do whatever you want with
this code, but keep sources open.
See LICENCE for more information.

Note:
The code might have a lot of bugs and structured
as is, because the person who wrote it is a
fucking braindamaged retard (me), so, please,
keep it in mind when you use it.
