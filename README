appointment-managing-bot-for-self-employed
==========================================

This bot is made for self employed people who provide
their service in person. It uses simple
contractor-client role model. At first, a contractor
creates a list of appointments (date and time records)
that are suitable for him/her (fit in his/her schedule).
Then, a client can make an appointment with the contractor
choosing the date-time record out of a list made by the
contractor. The only thing here that needed to be made
by contractor is to create these records.

For example, the contractor can be a manicurist (as a
person I have made this bot to), beauty master, tutor
or any other person who provides their service in
person and needs automatic appointment management.

Terms of use:
You can basically do whatever you want with
this code, but keep sources open.
See LICENCE for more information.

Note:
The code might have a lot of bugs and is structured
as is, because the person who wrote it is a
fucking braindamaged retard (me), so, please,
keep it in mind when you use it.

How to run:
You have to put config.json and locale.json into config folder.
Both files have to have Config.kt and Locale.kt constructor parameter
names accordingly. If you don't know your dev and contractor chat id,
start the bot and use /_id command, id of your chat will be logged at
INFO level. If you leave locale.json empty, default english locale will
be used. You have to specify config.json path as program argument.
